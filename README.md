# Job Title Normalizer

This project implements a job title normalizer that compares non-normalized job titles with a list of standardized titles.

## Installation
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the directory: cd normalizer.
Compile the project: mvn clean install.

## Usage
For this test, I’ve kept it as simple as possible by running the Normalizer class directly from the IDE (using the “Run” command).

## A Bit More About the Application
This code reads normalized job titles from a text file, compares them with the input name, and returns the normalized version. It’s a straightforward solution that could be further improved.
